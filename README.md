Flexbox Module help control the arrangement of element in a box module easily

The following starts the whole flex thingy

    display: flex; /* makes everything flexible */

Now flex-direction controls the axes:

- main axis (horizontal by default)
- cross-axis (vertical by default)

  flex-direction: column; /_ by default it is row _/

other values for flex-directions are:

- row (main axis will be horizontal)
- row-reverse (main axis will also be horizontal but element arranged right to left)
- column (main axis will become vertical)
- column reverse (main axis will also be vertical but elements will be arranged from bottom to top)
